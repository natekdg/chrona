    <h2>what is pomodoro anyway.</h2>
<p>you may have heard of the many techniques used to study and/or get work done efficiently. the pomodoro technique is one such popular method. it was developed by francesco cirillo in the late 1980s and is named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer ("pomodoro" is italian for "tomato") that he used as a university student.</p>
<p>the basic idea is simple yet effective: break your work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. these intervals are called "pomodoros." after completing four pomodoros, you take a longer break, typically 15-30 minutes. this method helps maintain focus and prevents burnout by giving you regular breaks.</p>

<h2>how to implement the pomodoro technique.</h2>
<p>implementing the pomodoro technique is easy and requires just a few steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>choose any task you want to work on.</li>
    <li>use this timer for setting a 25 minute interval.</li>
    <li>when the timer rings, take a short break (i typically recommend about 5 minutes).</li>
    <li>repeat the process, and after four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).</li>
</ol>

<h2>benefits of the pomodoro technique.</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>improved focus:</strong> working in short bursts helps you maintain concentration and avoid distractions.</li>
